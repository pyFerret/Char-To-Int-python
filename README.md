# Char To Int

#### This python module can convert a single character or a string into the ASCII value of that character.

To use it, download the `cti.py` file, make sure it is in the same folder as the project you are working on and write `import cti`

---

#### Functions

`cti.example()` takes nothing; will show the basic functions you can do

`cti.single()` takes a string of one character; will return an integer

`cti.multi()` takes a string of any amount and a boolean; will return a list (array) if the boolean is `False`, and a more readable string if ` True`

`cti.prtMulti()` takes a string of any amount; will return a list (array) and print a more readable string to the console.

`cti.bin()` takes a string of any amount; will return an array of binary values

NOTE: any characters given that are not in the accepted data will return a blank value (0 for single; nothing for multi)
